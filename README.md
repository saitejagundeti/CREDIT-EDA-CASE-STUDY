# CREDIT-EDA-CASE-STUDY
This Case Study gives a basic understanding of risk analytics in Banking &amp; Financial services and how the data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to the customers.
Problem Statement:
This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
